# 8 Rooks Problem

### C# Project by Ey√ºp Barlas (Bzzman)

8 rooks will be added on a chessboard randomly, one by one. But their paths shall not be crossed. After placement of a rook, next rook's place will be selected randomly and
a function will check if the new place is valid or not. Every step will be printed on console.
